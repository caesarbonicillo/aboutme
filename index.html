        <p> Hello and welcome to my website! My name is David and I am studying to be a web developer. Aside from attaining a Full-Stack Certificate to work for a tech company, I plan on making my own website to chronicle my life, all the wierd things that happend to me, and general strangeness I observe.
        </p>

        <p> I think the most important thing in my life that has always got my through the day is my love of dogs. And let me tell you I <strong><em>LOVE</em></strong> dogs. I've had 4 dogs in my life.
        </p>

        <h1>MY DOGS</h1>
        <ul> 
          <li>Ranier</li>
          <li>Buddy</li>
          <li>Aiko</li>
          <li>Alma</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although I've had dogs I've never actually had a new dog.  They were all used dogs that I've found on the street. Ranier was a dog that wandered into my yard when I was 5 and wouldn't leave when his owner came. Buddy was a dog my mom's coworker found that had been hit by a car. Aiko was a box dog my brother found in Okinawa when he was in the Marines. And Alma was a dog that my sister found in Arizona that was abandoned.
        </p>

        <p>I want a new dog though! A young one preferably....Like a <strong>puppy</strong> I've only ever had mutts, but right now here's a list of my <strong>Top Three Dog Breeds</strong>. 
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Shikoku Ken</li>
          <li>Irish Glenn of Imaal</li>
          <li>Corgi</li>
        </ol>
