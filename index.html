        <p> Hello and welcome to my website! My name is David and I am studying to be a web developer. Aside from attaining a Full-Stack Certificate to work for a tech company, I plan on making my own website to chronicle my life, all the wierd things that happend to me, and general strangeness I observe.
        </p>

        <p> I think the most important thing in my life that has always got my through the day is my love of dogs. And let me tell you I <strong><em>LOVE</em></strong> dogs. I've had 3 dogs in my life.
        </p>

        <h1>MY DOGS</h1>
        <ul> 
          <li>
          <img src= '/Users/davidbonicillo/codefellows/201/aboutme/img/ranier.jpg' alt='rotwieller'>
              <h3>Ranier</h3>
          </li>
          <li>
          <img src= '/Users/davidbonicillo/codefellows/201/aboutme/img/buddystand.jpg'
          alt='dog standing'>
              <h3>Buddy</h3>
          <li>
              <img src='/Users/davidbonicillo/codefellows/201/aboutme/img/aikosmiling.jpg' alt='black and white dog'>
              </a>
              <!-- <div class='content'> -->
                <h3>Aiko</h3>
              <!-- </div> -->
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although I've had dogs I've never actually had a new dog.  They were all used dogs that I've found on the street. Ranier was a dog that wandered into my yard when I was 5 and wouldn't leave when his owner came. Buddy was a dog my mom's coworker found that had been hit by a car. And Aiko was a box dog my brother found in Okinawa when he was in the Marines.
        </p>

        <p>I want a new dog though! A young one preferably....Like a <strong>puppy</strong> I've only ever had mutts, but right now here's a list of my <strong>Top Three Dog Breeds</strong>. 
        </p>
